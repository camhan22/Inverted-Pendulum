# Inverted-Pendulum
PID Controlled Inverted Pendulum

This is a inverted pendulum system that uses a digital PID controller

The PID.cpp, PID.h, and Keywords.txt files are a stand alone digital PID controller that has variable time stepping meaning both micros() and millis() can be used with it. The controller expects to see a 0-1023 input which is the standrad data from the analog pins. However, this can be updated to work with any input range.

The STL files will be uploaded shortly as well as pictures of the completed project
